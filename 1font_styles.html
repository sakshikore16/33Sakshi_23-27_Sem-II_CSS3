<!-- 1. Design a web page using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
whichincludes the following:

Use different font, styles:
In the style definition you define how each selector should work
(font,color etc.). Then, in the body of your pages, you refer to
these selectors to activate the styles. -->

<!-- Theory:
HTML and CSS work together to create visually appealing and structured 
web pages. In the provided code, the HTML defines the structure of the 
page, including headings, paragraphs, and classes for styling. CSS is 
used to apply styles such as font family, size, and colors to 
elements like headings and paragraphs. The combination of HTML and
CSS allows for the creation of a cohesive and styled web page. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Styled Page</title>
    <style>
      body {
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
        font-size: 16px;
        color: #333;
      }
      h1 {
        font-size: 36px;
        color: #f00;
      }
      p {
        font-size: 20px;
        color: #00f;
      }
      .highlight {
        background-color: #ff0;

  <body>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <p class="highlight">This is a highlighted paragraph.</p>

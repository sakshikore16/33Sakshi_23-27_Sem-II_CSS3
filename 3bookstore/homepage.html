<!-- Theory:
The provided HTML code outlines the structure of a bookstore website, 
featuring sections for book listings, categories, and a search bar. 
Each book listing includes a title, author, description, and price. 
CSS is used to style the webpage with a responsive layout, consistent 
typography, color scheme, and button styles. The use of classes and 
IDs in HTML allows for targeted styling and interactive elements like 
dropdown menus and search functionality. -->
